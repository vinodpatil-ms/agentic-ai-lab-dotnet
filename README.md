## 🚀 Getting Started
### Step 1: Repository Setup

```powershell
# Clone the laboratory repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/agentic-ai-lab-dotnet.git
cd agentic-ai-lab

# Verify Python version
dotnet --version  # Should be 10.0.0 or higher
```

### Step 2: Azure AI Foundry Setup

1. **Create Azure AI Foundry Resource and Project**
   
   To create an AI Foundry resource in the Azure portal follow these instructions:

   - Select this AI Foundry resource link: https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAIFoundry

   - On the Create page, provide the following information:

   <img src="images/ai-foundry-deployment.png" width="75%"/>

   | Project details | Description |
   |----------------|-------------|
   | **Subscription** | Select one of your available Azure subscriptions. |
   | **Resource group** | The Azure resource group that will contain your Azure AI Foundry resource. You can create a new group or add it to a preexisting group. |
   | **Region** | The location of your Azure AI service instance. Different locations may introduce latency, but have no impact on the runtime availability of your resource. |
   | **Name** | A descriptive name for your Azure AI Foundry resource. For example, MyAIServicesResource. |
   | **Default Project Name** | Keep the default project as it is. |

   - Keep other settings for your resource as default, read and accept the conditions (as applicable), and then select **Review + create**.
   
2. **Deploy Required Models & Services**
   
   | Model Type | Recommended Models | Purpose |
   |------------|-------------------|---------|
   | **Chat/Completion** | `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini` | Primary reasoning & conversation |
   | **Text Embeddings** | `text-embedding-3-large` | Vector search & RAG |

   - On the left Nav Menu of the foundry portal go to Models+endpoints
   - Click Deploy a model button-->Deploy base model
      - Search for the models in the table above , select a model, click confirm and Deploy and connect
       <img src="images/deploy-models.png" width="75%"/>

3. **Configure an Azure Search Service**
   - Create an Azure AI Search resource in Azure
   - Connect this resource to your AI Foundry project
      - Navigate to your AI Foundry project → Management Center → Connected Resources → Add Connection → Select Azure AI Search
      <img src="images/foundry-connection.png" width="75%"/>

4. **Configure Grounding with Bing Search**
   - Create a new Grounding with Bing Search resource in Azure
   - Connect this resource to your AI Foundry project
      - Navigate to your AI Foundry project → Management Center → Connected Resources → Add Connection → Select Grounding with Bing Search

5. **Create Content Understanding Resource**
   - Create an Azure AI Content Understanding multi-service resource following the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/how-to/create-multi-service-resource)
   - Ensure the resource is created in a supported region (westus, swedencentral, australiaeast)
  
6. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the root directory and update values accordingly
   - This repository expects the `.env` file to be in the root directory, if you want to store it elsewhere or name it something else, update the `load_dotenv()` calls in notebooks
   - Many of the Environment Variables needed can be found in the Overview tab of your Azure AI Foundry project or the connected resources in the Management Center tab
   - For example, AZURE_OPENAI variables-

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Support

### ⚡ Common Issues & Solutions

**Azure Authentication Issues:**
```powershell
# Recommended: Use Azure CLI authentication
az login --tenant YOUR_TENANT_ID
az account show

# Alternative: Clear cached credentials and re-login
az account clear
az login --tenant YOUR_TENANT_ID
az account show
